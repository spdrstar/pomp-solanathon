# Introduction to POMP

POMP (Proof of Membership Protocol) is a **branded and personalized profile photo** that proves a member's affiliation with a community (company, school, club etc.) on the Solana blockchain.

> Each POMP is created through a fun onboarding process where a verified member takes a selfie or uploads a photo to layer on a branded image/AR filter tailored to the specific organization.

POMPs are frozen Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which means that **each POMP is unique and cannot be transferred** to anyone else on the blockchain. This enables members to build their reputation and identity on-chain through the communities they are a part of.

## Why use POMP?

### Community pride and belonging

POMP cultivates a sense of belonging and pride by allowing members to create a branded profile photo that incorporates their identity and acts as a token to celebrate new milestones like joining a new organization.

### Organic social media marketing

Since POMPs are designed to be used as profile photos, organizations can organically increase brand awareness and marketing reach on social media through their membersâ€™ networks.

### Verification and Access

Each POMP is a verification of membership which can be used to give gated access to special perks reserved just for the members.

### Build reputation on-chain

Each POMP is non-transferable and on-chain, allowing members to build up their reputation and credibility in web3.

### Fun Experience

Creating a POMP is a unique way to engage a new or existing member to create a personalized and branded profile photo.

## How POMP works

### For organizations

1. Sign up to get verified as an organization (manual onboarding)

2. Upload a branded POMP (image or AR filter) tailored to your organization

3. Confirm the list of members and verification mechanism to receive the POMP drop

4. Send your organization's unique POMP link to your members

### For Members

1. Click on POMP link from your organization

2. Verify that you are a member (via email authentication, wallet address etc.)

3. Create your personalized POMP by taking a selfie or uploading a photo with the branded filter

4. Mint your POMP and share it on your socials as your profile photo!

## How POMP is built

Each POMP is a frozen NFT built on the solana blockchain.

## Next steps

Beyond the Thirdweb x Solana hackathon, we would like to continue building the following:

- Integrate AR filters
- Create an onboarding process for organizations to integrate/share their members' list for verification
- Integrate dynamic NFTs that allow for updates to the original POMP to reflect member milestones
- Rebrand logo/visual design and build refined UI
- Conduct usability testing and gain feedback from users
